Subject: share/mk/: install-man: Don't pipe to install(1)
MIME-Version: 1.0

install(1) doesn't work well in Darwin.  It seems to be unable to handle
</dev/stdin>.  The problem seems to be that Darwin's stdin misbehaves.

I've only workarounded the install target, and not the dist target,
since it's unlikely that one would run it in such a broken system.  But
since installing the pages is a common operation that everybody needs,
let's work around it here.

Fixes: 30c38a8bf8ae ("*.mk: Pipe to install(1)")
